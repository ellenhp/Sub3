Sub^3
=====
Sub^3 aims to be a realistic multiplayer submarine simulator. The goal of Sub^3 isn't to be the best sub sim out there, but to have the best sonar modelling of any civilian simulation available. To accomplish this, it will use [USML](https://github.com/campreilly/UnderSeaModelingLibrary) for all acoustic simulation. Sub^3 currently uses [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML) for graphics, networking and input. It also uses [SFGUI](https://github.com/TankOs/SFGUI) for the user interface and [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) to support the multiplayer networking code.

Current Status
--------------
Sub^3 is completely unplayable at the moment, but that should change! Development takes place at https://github.com/nopoe/Sub3
